\title{A function to compute weighted ordinal pattern statistics}
\usage{
weighted_ordinal_pattern_distribution(x, ndemb, weight.fun)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector (e.g. a time series), from which the weighted ordinal pattern distribution is to be calculated}

\item{ndemb}{Embedding dimension of the ordinal patterns (i.e. sliding window size). Should be chosen such as length(x) >> ndemb}

\item{weight.fun}{Function to weight each pattern accordin to a user-specified function. This function must return one value. Default is to 'var.fun', which generates variance-based weights (see Fadlallah et al 2013).}
}
\value{
A character verctor of length factorial(ndemb) is returned.
}
\description{
Computation of weighted ordinal patterns of a time series. Weights can be generated by a user-specified function (e.g. variance-weighted, see Fadlallah et al 2013).
}
\details{
This function returns the distribution of weighted ordinal patterns using the Keller coding scheme, detailed in Physica A 356 (2005) 114-120. NA values are allowed.
}
\examples{
x = arima.sim(model=list(ar = 0.3), n = 10^4)
weighted_ordinal_pattern_distribution(x = x, ndemb = 6, weight.fun = var.fun)
