Description: An implementation of local and global statistical complexity
    measures for time series analysis in R. The package provides functions to
    compute Information Theory Quantifiers (ITQ's), i.e. statistical complexity and information measures for any given time
    series based on ordinal pattern statistics (Bandt and Pompe 2002). The ordinal pattern
    statistics are used to calculate a variety of global (Permutation Entropy, MPR
    complexity) and local (Fisher Information) complexity and information measures
    (for further information, see Martin, Plastino and Rosso 2006; Olivares et al
    2012). In addition, methods to derive variance-weighted ordinal pattern distributions (see e.g. Fadlallah et al 2013), 
    and several distance measures (Hellinger distance, Jensen-Shannon divergence) are supplied.
    Deterministic-chaotic maps and stochastic processes are available for testing. 
    Complexity and information measures constitute a simple, quick and powerful tool to classify and cluster (a
    large number of) time series, including for model-data comparisons.
